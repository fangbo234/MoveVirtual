## step 1 : Object check with yolov10
*person recognition is needed if this is used in sport live broadcast*
## step 2 : pose check with mediapipe
## step 3 : depth estimate with intel/dpt-large
## step 4: build scene with scene recontruction
## step 5: build model with pose lanmark 
*in sport live broadcast,we can build realistic model ,for example, KD,Stepen curry,LBJ*
## step 6: put model to scene with depth data
*this is what need to do to deal one frame of video,if pose landmark data is incomplete,use pose estimate to build complete pose landmark
if pose landmark data in frame 1 is much different with model2,use some motion optimization algorithm.*
